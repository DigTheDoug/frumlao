					<h2>what is frumlao?</h2>
					<p>
					frumlao is the complete web solution for the indecisive developer. 
					How often have you been tasked to create a website only to spend hours drooling in a 
					stupor in front of your monitor at the sheer magnitude of starting points. 
					You spend days researching and testing out various languages and frameworks,
					each of them with even more ridiculous and nonsensical sounding names than the last. 
					And then you get the joyful task of starting the entire process over again looking for a 
					cms to manage all of your internets. After more research and more testing and even more 
					ridiculous sounding names you finally get it hooked up. And then you realize you have 
					no hope in hell of getting it to work with the design you were given. Time for a new
					solution. Rewind. Restart. Ridiculous.
					<br /><br />
					frumlao is the complete and final solution to these situations. frumlao is a language,
					framework and cms all in one. There is never any need sift through the plethora 
					(I would say...about a plethora) of combinations of solutions. frumlao can be used on 
					every website you ever make. And you'll never have to re-architect it again.
					<br /><br />
					frumlao is freedom.
					</p>
					<br />
					<h2>but how does it work?</h2>
					<p>
					Quite simple actually. frumlao saves hundreds of hours of time spent researching and
					implementing and re-architecting your website. How? It does it for you. I know. 
					It's genious, but bear with me. Upon installation frumlao will connect to a database
					of popular web programming languages (Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby etc.) and pick one at random.
					From that language it will then again randomly choose an application framework that uses it
					(Django, Qcodo, Grok, Snu Snu etc.) and begin to architect your site. 
					Its final step is to choose a cms (Umbraco, Joomla, MoinMoin etc.) and hook it 
					into your previously created system! But that's not even the best part. Oh no. If we stopped there 
					it would only be saving you a little time. What happens when you inevitably want to change the 
					technology next week? frumlao is not just a magic 8-ball that give you an initial solution
					only to leave you hanging when you need it most. At random intervals anywhere from one day to two weeks
					frumlao will automatically rearchitecht your entire technology solution and automatically apply it to
					your website.
					<br /><br />
					frumlao is fantastic.
					</p>
					<br />
					<h2>will it break my website?</h2>
					<p>
					Wow. I just spent months trying to help you out and save you 
					precious time and sweat and you just doubt me right off the bat without even getting to know me
					first. I typed my fingers to their raw, bloody stumps. It completely ruined my keyboard. And then
					I had no choice but to switch to my feet. Yeah, typing with your feet isn't fucking easy. The doctor said I 
					probably wouldn't ever be able to walk anymore due to the irreversible damage I caused. 
					I thought it was worth it because I really just wanted to make you happy. You know what? 
					Forget it, you don't even deserve frumlao.
					<br /><br />
					frumlao is fickle.
