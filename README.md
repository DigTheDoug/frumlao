what is frumlao?
=======

**frumlao** is the complete web technology solution for the indecisive developer.

How often have you been tasked to create a website only to spend hours drooling in a 
stupor in front of your monitor at the sheer magnitude of starting points. 
You spend days researching and testing out various languages and frameworks,
each of them with even more ridiculous and nonsensical sounding names than the last. 
And then you get the joyful task of starting the entire process over again looking for a 
cms to manage all of your internets. After more research and more testing and even more 
ridiculous sounding names you finally get it hooked up. And then you realize you have 
no hope in hell of getting it to work with the design you were given. Time for a new
solution. Rewind. Restart. Ridiculous.

**frumlao** is the complete and final solution to these situations. frumlao is a language,
a framework, cms and everything you need it to be all in one. There is never any need sift through the plethora 
(I would say...about a plethora) of combinations of solutions. **frumlao** can be used on 
every website you ever make. And you'll never have to re-architect it again.

***frumlao is freedom***

but how does it work?
=======

Quite simply actually. **frumlao** saves hundreds of hours of time spent researching and implementing 
and re-architecting your website. How? It does it for you. I know. It's genious, but bear with me. 
Upon installation frumlao will connect to a database of popular web programming languages 
(Python, Ruby, Perl, PHP, ASP.NET, Java etc.) and pick one ~~at random~~ using a complex series of patent pending 
and open sourced algorithms. From that language it will then again ~~randomly~~ intelligently
choose an application framework or something else somehwat related that probably uses it (Django, Flask, 
Qcodo, Grok, Snu Snu etc.) and begin to design and organically architect your site using complex learning AIs.
Its final step is to choose a cms (Umbraco, Joomla, MoinMoin etc.) and hook it into 
your previously created system! But that's not even the best part. Oh no. If we stopped there it would
only be saving you a little time. What happens when you inevitably want to change the technology next week? 
**frumlao** is not just a magic 8-ball that give you an initial solution only to leave you hanging when you 
need it most. At random intervals anywhere from one day to two weeks **frumlao** will automatically 
rearchitecht your entire technology solution and automatically apply it to your website. 

***frumlao is fantastic.***

will it break my website?
======

Wow. I just spent months trying to help you out and save you precious time and sweat and you just doubt me
right off the bat without even getting to know me first. I typed my fingers to their raw, bloody stumps. 
It completely ruined my keyboard. And then I had no choice but to switch to my feet. Yeah, typing with your 
feet isn't fucking easy. The doctor said I probably wouldn't ever be able to walk anymore due to the 
irreversible damage I caused. I thought it was worth it because I really just wanted to make you happy. 
You know what? Forget it, you don't even deserve **frumlao**.
